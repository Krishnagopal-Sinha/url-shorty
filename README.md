# URL Shawty

Heyy there! Welcome to URL Shawty project, a chill and minimal URL shortener built with FastAPI (Python) and React (TS). Let's get started!

---

## Backend Setup (FastAPI + Postgres)

1. **Clone the repo**

   ```bash
   git clone <this-repo-url>
   cd url_shortner_proj
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment with [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)**

   ```bash
   uv venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

   (If you don't have `uv`, just `pip install uv` globally!)

3. **Install Python dependencies**

   ```bash
   uv pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up your Postgres database**

   - Make sure you have Postgres running on **port 5430** (not the default 5432!).
   - You can use Docker, Homebrew, or your favorite method. Example with Docker:
     ```bash
     docker run --name urlshawty-db -e POSTGRES_USER=shawty -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=shawtypass -e POSTGRES_DB=shawtydb -p 5430:5432 -d postgres:15
     ```
   - Update your `.env` file with the correct DB credentials if needed.

5. **Fire up the backend!**
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```
   - The API will be live at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
   - Docs are at [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)

## Frontend Setup (React + Vite)

The frontend lives in the `frontend/` folder. It's built with React, Vite, and Tailwind for a super snappy experience.

1. **Hop into the frontend folder**

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   npm i
   # or
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Start the dev server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   pnpm dev
   ```
   - The app will be at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
   - Make sure your backend is running for full functionality!

   You can also build the file to serve it from BE
   ```bash
   npm run build
   # or
   pnpm build
   ```

## Tradeoffs

- BE trackable analytics feature was not included as we wanted to ensure scalability is important, so made use of 301 redirect for cahcing on client's browser, thus, our redirect API will be only hit once per specific url
- I was thinking of adding redis too for frequently used urls but since it wasn't mentioned in requirement docs, I did not use it
- Since postgreSQL was mentioned in requirement I used it but for scaling, NoSQL db like mongoDB or supabase will better...

## File Structure (Quick Peek)

- `main.py` — FastAPI backend entrypoint
- `db/` — Database models and logic
- `frontend/` — All the React code (UI, hooks, components, etc.)
- `.env` — Your environment variables (DB creds, etc.)

---

## Notes

- The backend expects Postgres on port **5430**.
- CORS is set up for local dev and production builds.
- The frontend is clean, fast and has support for dark and light mode.
- If you run into any issues, just open an issue or ping me!
